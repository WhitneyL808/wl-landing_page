## What Is This? 
My DIY Landing Page with these features. 

* My content. My design.
* Customizable, and persistent URL e.g. `YourCustomName.Netlify.app`
* Portable. Take it to any web host. 
* Future proof, and easy to maintain. You own the code via GitHub
* Secure, and scalable to many CDNs worldwide via Netlify

## Why Does This Exist? 
Many services offer a single-page-landing. These "web portals" have existed for decades before [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/), [About.Me](https://about.me), [Card](https://carrd.co/), etc.

There are too many services to choose from. Each one has minor differences, and benefits with premium paid upgrades.
